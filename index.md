Question: **What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?** \\
The most interesting topic that was covered in my domain this quarter was the interpretability of LLMs.
While I use ChatGPT, I don't acknowledge the credibility of these models. From the perspective of say a 
lawyer or a doctor who is utilizing this type of technology, it was is imperative to be able to understand
the biases of these models. Since models of this size are essentially a blackbox, I find this topic of 
model interpretability quite interesting.
