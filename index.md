**Hey there!** My name is [Steven Luong](sxluong@ucsd.edu).
- The current section that I am in is A14 and my mentor is Lily Weng.

Question: **What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?** <br>

The most interesting topic that was covered in my domain this quarter was the interpretability of LLMs.
While I use ChatGPT, I don't acknowledge the credibility of these models. From the perspective of say a 
lawyer or a doctor who is utilizing this type of technology, it is important to be able to understand
the biases of these models. Since models of this size are essentially a blackbox, I find this topic of 
model interpretability quite interesting.

Question: **Describe  a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**

Right now, I am building a gui to build and modify Concept Bottle Neck models for LLMs. The modification part is about rectifiying the model after it has been built, by pruning concepts and retraining. However, I am looking into also doing this for computer vision models as well (e.i. ResNet-50...).

Question: **What is a potential change you'd make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**

A potential change I'd make would be to build a timeline of accomplishable tasks. Right now, there is many ideas to implement. A believe a more formatted and organized push would be very beneficial. In fact, that is what my group and I are trying to do. To pin tasks and map out deadlines like this was a project to be delivered to a company.

Question: **What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**

Recently, we were interested in using a full-stack framework to build our gui. It is much more intuitive to build it on a microservice architecture. We are opting to using Django to build out gui/site/web-application.
Or maybe we will just use Django REST Framework and React.
